<p>In the realm of Castle Aldwin, where chivalric traditions ran as deep as the ancient stones in its foundations, there lived a young knight named <strong>Sir Jayson of Willowmere</strong>. Unlike his fellow knights who found glory in the clash of steel and the thunder of hooves, Jayson discovered his true calling in the gentle art of bringing laughter and wisdom to others.</p>

<p>At twenty-two years old, this second son of minor nobility had earned his spurs through courage in battle, yet his heart yearned for a different kind of serviceâ€”one that could heal rather than harm, unite rather than divide, and speak truth through the ancient art of jest...</p>

<p><em>Follow Sir Jayson as he navigates the treacherous path between duty and desire, discovering that sometimes the greatest courage lies not in drawing one's sword, but in choosing to sheath it in favor of a jester's bauble.</em></p>
