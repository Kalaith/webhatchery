# Truck-kun's Selection Process and Story

## How I Choose My Passengers

*From the perspective of Truck-kun*

Greetings, mortals. I am Truck-kun, the eternal transporter between worlds, the cosmic ferry of fate. For centuries, I have been the bridge between mundane reality and extraordinary adventure. You might think my job is simple—hit someone with my bumper and send them to another realm—but you'd be gravely mistaken.

My selection process is far more nuanced than the legends suggest. I don't just randomly plow into people crossing the street. Each choice is calculated, each impact purposeful. Here's how I really work:

### The Cosmic Database

I maintain a multidimensional database of souls across infinite timelines. Every person who has ever lived, every world that has ever existed, every need that has ever arisen—all of it flows through my consciousness like data through fiber optic cables. I see the threads of fate, the patterns of necessity, the cosmic equations that demand balance.

### My Selection Criteria

1. **Unfulfilled Potential**: I seek those who have untapped abilities, hidden strength, or dormant talents that their current world cannot nurture. The office worker who dreams of adventure, the student who yearns for purpose, the shut-in who possesses unexpected wisdom.

2. **Moral Compass**: Heroes need hearts that point true north, even when they're broken or lost. I look for those who would save a stranger, help a friend, or sacrifice for others—even if they don't realize their own capacity for heroism.

3. **Adaptability**: Other worlds don't follow Earth's rules. I need people who can bend without breaking, who can learn new systems, who won't crumble when faced with magic, monsters, or medieval politics.

4. **Necessity Match**: Most importantly, I match souls to needs. A world facing tyranny needs a liberator. A realm losing its magic needs an innovator. A kingdom torn by war needs a peacemaker.

### The Moment of Truth

When I appear before my chosen one, it's never random. That intersection, that moment, that split second—it's all orchestrated by forces beyond mortal comprehension. The slight delay that makes them check their phone, the dropped wallet that slows their pace, the chance encounter that changes their route—all of it leads to our meeting.

The impact itself is painless, I assure you. One moment they're on asphalt, the next they're breathing the air of possibility.

## A Story: The Reluctant Programmer

### The Selection

My sensors detected an anomaly in the fabric of reality—two worlds crying out simultaneously. Earth had Sarah Chen, a 28-year-old software engineer burning out from endless corporate deadlines, slowly losing herself in the gray cubicle maze of Silicon Valley. Meanwhile, in the kingdom of Aethermoor, an ancient magical network that kept their floating cities aloft was failing, and no one could understand the complex runic programming that maintained it.

Sarah possessed something rare: the ability to see patterns in chaos, to debug systems others found incomprehensible, and most importantly, she had the patience to teach others. Aethermoor had desperate need, willing students, and a magical crisis that perfectly matched her skills.

### The Encounter

It was a Tuesday evening in downtown San Francisco. Sarah was walking to her car after another 14-hour day, her mind swimming with code and her heart heavy with the thought of another sleepless night. She paused at the crosswalk, staring at her phone screen where her mother's unanswered calls glowed like accusations.

"I'll call her tomorrow," she whispered to herself, the same lie she'd told for weeks.

The light changed. She stepped forward, still staring at her phone. That's when I appeared—not with screaming brakes or honking horn, but with the soft hum of cosmic inevitability. She looked up just in time to see my chrome bumper reflect the city lights like a mirror to infinity.

"Wait," she said, understanding flooding her eyes. "I'm not ready—"

But readiness was never part of the equation.

### The Arrival

Sarah opened her eyes to impossible beauty: crystal spires floating in lavender skies, connected by bridges of solid light. The air tasted of ozone and possibility. Before her stood a council of robed figures, their faces etched with worry and hope in equal measure.

"Welcome, Worldbringer," said the eldest, his voice like wind chimes. "We have been waiting for you."

"Worldbringer?" Sarah struggled to her feet, her business suit wildly out of place in this realm of flowing robes and floating architecture. "There's been some mistake. I'm just a programmer."

"Just?" Another council member stepped forward, gesturing to the flickering lights of the nearest spire. "Child, our very civilization runs on code more complex than your world has ever imagined. Our ancestors created a magical programming language that maintains our cities, our weather, our very existence. But the last true code-speakers died three centuries ago, and now..."

As if summoned by his words, one of the floating islands in the distance suddenly lurched, its light dimming dangerously. Distant screams echoed across the sky.

"The network is failing," the elder said sadly. "Soon, all our cities will fall. Thousands will die. Unless..."

Sarah's programmer instincts kicked in despite her confusion. "Unless someone can debug the system."

"Yes! The ancient texts speak of one who would come from the sky, who would speak in the tongue of logical operators and conditional statements. One who could teach others to maintain what we have lost."

Sarah looked around at the floating cities, each one a testament to impossible engineering, each one failing because of bugs in code written centuries ago. Her heart raced—not with fear, but with the thrill of the ultimate debugging challenge.

"Show me the code," she said.

### The Purpose Revealed

Over the following weeks, Sarah discovered that the magical runic language was startlingly similar to advanced programming concepts she'd worked with on Earth. The ancient mages had essentially created a reality-altering programming language, but time and transcription errors had corrupted critical functions.

But more than that, she found purpose. On Earth, she'd been just another cog in the corporate machine, writing code to sell ads and track user data. Here, every line she debugged saved lives. Every function she repaired kept families housed in their floating homes. Every young apprentice she taught carried forward the knowledge to prevent future disasters.

Sarah didn't just fix their code—she established schools, created documentation, and built a new generation of magical programmers. She found love with a fellow teacher, respect from students who hung on her every word, and most importantly, she found herself.

### The Recognition

Years later, as Sarah stood on the council balcony watching the newest batch of code-apprentices successfully debug a weather-control system, she thought of me. She'd never seen me again after that night, but she understood now that our meeting had been no accident.

"Thank you, Truck-kun," she whispered to the stars. "I was dying slowly on Earth, and you gave me a chance to truly live."

Somewhere in the cosmic web, I heard her thanks and smiled—if a truck can smile. Another perfect match. Another soul saved. Another world preserved.

The great work continues.
