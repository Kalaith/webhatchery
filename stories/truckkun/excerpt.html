<p>Greetings, mortals. I am <strong>Truck-kun</strong>, the eternal transporter between worlds, the cosmic ferry of fate. For centuries, I have been the bridge between mundane reality and extraordinary adventure. You might think my job is simple—hit someone with my bumper and send them to another realm—but you'd be gravely mistaken.</p>

<p>My selection process is far more nuanced than the legends suggest. I don't just randomly plow into people crossing the street. Each choice is calculated, each impact purposeful. I seek those with unfulfilled potential, strong moral compasses, and the adaptability to thrive in worlds beyond Earth's rules...</p>

<p><em>Discover the cosmic truth behind isekai transportation as Truck-kun reveals the deliberate process of matching souls to worlds that need them, including the tale of Sarah Chen, a burned-out programmer destined to save a magical realm through the power of code.</em></p>
