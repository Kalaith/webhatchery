# Dungeon Master Game - Player Guide

## Game Overview
You are the **Dungeon Master** in this reverse RPG experience. Instead of playing as adventurers, you manage a party of NPCs who make requests, ask questions, and suggest actions. Your job is to guide their story and keep the adventure engaging.

## How to Play

### 1. Understanding Your Role
- **You are the DM**: Make decisions about what happens in the story
- **NPCs are the players**: They will make requests and suggestions
- **Guide the narrative**: Choose how the story unfolds based on NPC actions

### 2. Your Party Members

**Gareth the Bold (Fighter)**
- Personality: Aggressive and brave
- Wants to charge into danger and fight enemies
- Gets excited by combat opportunities

**Luna the Wise (Wizard)**
- Personality: Cautious and scholarly
- Prefers research and careful planning
- Suggests magical solutions and preparation

**Pip the Curious (Rogue)**
- Personality: Impulsive and inquisitive

### 3. Game Mechanics

**Story Tension**
- Increases with dangerous decisions
- Decreases with safe choices
- High tension triggers complications
- Low tension may bore the NPCs

**Party Morale**
- Affected by your responses to NPC requests
- Approving requests generally increases morale
- Denying too many requests decreases morale

**Resources**
- Track gold, supplies, and reputation
- Used for various story elements
- Managed through your decisions

### 4. Response Options

When NPCs make requests, you can:
- **Approve**: Let them try their suggested action
- **Deny**: Refuse their request (may hurt morale)
- **Modify**: Suggest a variation of their idea
- **Alternative**: Propose something completely different
- **Custom Response**: Write your own response

### 5. Story Progression

- Each decision moves the story forward
- Random events keep things interesting
- NPCs react based on their personalities
- Multiple scenarios and locations to explore

## Tips for Success

1. **Balance personalities**: Don't always favor one NPC's suggestions
2. **Manage tension**: Mix safe and dangerous choices
3. **Consider party morale**: Happy NPCs make better suggestions
4. **Use custom responses**: Add your own creative input to the story
5. **Let NPCs be themselves**: Each has distinct personality traits

## Winning the Game

There's no traditional "win condition" - the goal is to create an engaging, collaborative story with your NPC party. Success is measured by:
- Keeping NPCs engaged and happy
- Creating interesting story moments
- Balancing action with planning
- Making decisions that feel true to a fantasy adventure

Have fun being the DM and let your NPCs guide you on an adventure!
