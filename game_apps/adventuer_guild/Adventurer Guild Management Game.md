# Adventurer Guild Management Game

I've created a comprehensive web-based guild management game where you take on the role of a guild master, building and leading your own adventurer organization. The game features a rich fantasy setting with multiple interconnected systems for hiring, quest management, and character progression.

## Game Overview

The **Guild Master** application puts you in charge of running a medieval fantasy adventurer guild. Starting with basic resources and a single fighter, you'll grow your organization by recruiting diverse adventurers, managing complex quests, and building your guild's reputation throughout the realm.

## Core Gameplay Features

### **Adventurer Management System**

- **Five Distinct Classes**: Fighter, Mage, Rogue, Cleric, and Ranger, each with unique stats and specializations
- **Character Progression**: Adventurers advance through five ranks from Novice to Legendary
- **Dynamic Recruitment**: Hire from a rotating pool of available candidates with randomized names and abilities
- **Status Tracking**: Monitor each adventurer's availability, quest assignments, and combat readiness


### **Quest Assignment \& Management**

The game features a comprehensive quest system with six different mission types ranging from simple goblin raids to legendary dragon encounters. Each quest has specific requirements, duration timers, and success probabilities based on your party composition.

### **Resource \& Progression Systems**

- **Gold Management**: Earn money from completed quests and spend it on hiring and upgrades
- **Reputation Building**: Success builds your guild's standing, unlocking better quests and recruits
- **Guild Leveling**: Advance your guild to increase adventurer capacity and quest slots
- **Real-time Mechanics**: Quests complete over time with live countdown timers


## Interface Design

The game features a tabbed interface with five main sections:

- **Guild Hall**: Overview dashboard with current status and active missions
- **Adventurers**: Detailed roster management with individual character profiles
- **Quest Board**: Mission selection and assignment interface
- **Hiring Hall**: Recruitment center with available candidates
- **Treasury**: Financial tracking and guild statistics

The visual design embraces a medieval fantasy aesthetic with warm earth tones, parchment textures, and ornate UI elements that create an immersive guild management experience.

## Strategic Gameplay

Success requires balancing multiple factors: matching adventurer classes to quest requirements, managing limited resources, timing quest assignments for optimal efficiency, and building a diverse roster capable of handling increasingly challenging missions. The progression system ensures that early game focuses on basic resource management while late game introduces complex multi-party strategies and high-stakes legendary quests.

The game saves automatically and provides immediate feedback through animations, sound effects, and visual notifications, creating an engaging experience that captures the essence of running a fantasy adventurer guild.
