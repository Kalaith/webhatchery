# GitHub Copilot Instructions

**NEVER USE run_in_terminal TOOL - COMMANDS DO NOT WORK**

## TERMINAL COMMAND RESTRICTIONS
**CRITICAL:** DO NOT use the `run_in_terminal` tool for ANY reason. Terminal commands are broken and will fail.

Instead of running commands:
- Create scripts that the user can run manually
- Use file manipulation tools (read_file, replace_string_in_file, create_file)
- Focus on code analysis and file-based solutions

## DO NOT RUN PHP SERVER
**IMPORTANT:** Do not automatically run the PHP development server using `run_in_terminal` or any other method. The user will manually start the server when needed.

Commands to NEVER run automatically:
- `php -S localhost:8000 -t public`
- `php -S localhost:8000`
- `php -S localhost:8000 -t public public/index.php`
- Any variant of PHP built-in server commands

The user will handle server startup manually when required for testing or development.

## Backend Development Guidelines

- Focus on code analysis, debugging, and file modifications
- Use read_file, replace_string_in_file, and other file manipulation tools
- Help with database queries, PHP code improvements, and architecture
- Assist with frontend-backend integration issues
- Do NOT start servers, databases, or long-running processes

## Allowed Terminal Commands

Only use terminal commands for:
- File operations (ls, dir, cat, etc.)
- Code analysis tools
- Package management (composer install, npm install) - but only when explicitly requested
- Git operations when needed

## Server Management

Let the user handle all server startup and management. Focus on helping with the code itself.
