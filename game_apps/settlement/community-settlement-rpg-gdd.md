# Community Settlement RPG - Game Design Document

## Executive Summary

**Community Settlement RPG** is a revolutionary community-driven role-playing experience that combines town-building mechanics with scheduled group roleplay sessions. Players create and manage persistent virtual settlements where real people assume the roles of individual villagers, meeting regularly to roleplay their daily lives and contribute to their community's growth.

The game transforms traditional MMO mechanics into a deeply social, scheduled experience where every villager role is filled by a real person who commits to playing their character during designated community times. Unlike typical online games where players control powerful heroes, this system focuses on ordinary citizens working together to build thriving settlements through collaborative roleplay and strategic resource management.

## Core Game Concept

### Vision Statement
Create an innovative community management RPG that bridges tabletop roleplay intimacy with persistent online world-building, where every citizen matters and real human connections drive virtual community growth.

### Target Audience
- **Primary**: Roleplay enthusiasts aged 18-35 who enjoy collaborative storytelling
- **Secondary**: Town-building and community management game fans
- **Tertiary**: Social gamers seeking meaningful online relationships and regular group activities

### Platform Strategy
- **Phase 1**: PC (Windows/Mac/Linux) with web-based community management tools
- **Phase 2**: Mobile companion app for out-of-session community management
- **Future**: Cross-platform expansion and VR integration potential

## Core Gameplay Mechanics

### Settlement Creation and Management

**Settlement Founding System:**
- Players can establish new settlements by meeting minimum requirements (initial resources, founding population commitments)
- Settlement founders become Mayor/Leaders with special administrative privileges
- Each settlement has a maximum population cap based on infrastructure development
- Settlement themes and rules can be customized by founders (medieval village, frontier town, steampunk commune, etc.)

**Community Slots System:**
- Each settlement offers specific community roles/jobs with associated responsibilities and abilities
- Slots include: Blacksmith, Baker, Guard Captain, Merchant, Healer, Scholar, Farmer, etc.
- Each role comes with unique gameplay screens, crafting abilities, and social responsibilities
- When players leave, their slots become available for recruitment via community boards

**Infrastructure and Expansion:**
- Settlements grow through collaborative infrastructure projects
- Building projects require specific combinations of resources, skills, and coordinated roleplay
- Successful infrastructure unlocks new community slots and settlement abilities
- Progression gates: Hamlet → Village → Town → City (each tier unlocks new roles and systems)

### Scheduled Roleplay Sessions

**Community Meeting System:**
- Each settlement establishes regular meeting schedules (e.g., 3 evenings per week, 2-4 hours each)
- All community members commit to attendance requirements when joining
- Sessions focus on in-character interactions, community decisions, and collaborative problem-solving
- Session activities include: town meetings, collaborative crafting, seasonal festivals, crisis response, trade negotiations

**Character Development:**
- Players develop their villager characters through consistent roleplay and skill usage
- Character progression tied to community contributions and roleplay quality
- Skill advancement affects both mechanical abilities and social standing within the settlement
- Character backstories and relationships evolve organically through shared experiences

### Resource and Economic Systems

**Community Resource Pools:**
- Settlements maintain shared resources (food, materials, gold, reputation)
- Individual roles contribute different resource types based on their profession
- Resource management requires coordination and planning during community sessions
- Seasonal events and challenges affect resource availability and consumption

**NPC Economic Integration:**
- Traveling NPC merchants create resource sinks and external trade opportunities
- NPC consumers purchase community goods, providing income streams
- Random events involving NPCs create challenges requiring community response
- NPC settlements can be established as trade partners or rivals

**Money Sink Mechanics:**
- Infrastructure maintenance costs prevent infinite resource accumulation
- Regular expenses: tool repairs, food consumption, building upkeep, seasonal preparations
- Emergency events: natural disasters, bandit raids, disease outbreaks requiring resource expenditure
- Luxury upgrades: decorative improvements, comfort amenities, cultural development

### Community Recruitment and Management

**Public Recruitment System:**
- In-game bulletin boards and external community forums for settlement recruitment
- Detailed job postings specify role requirements, time commitments, and settlement culture
- Application and interview processes managed by settlement leadership
- Example: "Everbrook Village seeks experienced Blacksmith. Must attend Tuesday/Thursday/Saturday 7-10pm EST. Current project: crafting lampposts for Town status promotion."

**Onboarding and Integration:**
- New community members receive guided introduction to settlement culture and systems
- Mentorship programs pair newcomers with established villagers
- Trial periods allow both sides to evaluate fit before permanent commitment
- Community feedback systems help maintain positive group dynamics

## Advanced Features and Expansion

**Regional Map System:**
- Multiple settlements exist on shared regional maps
- Trade routes, diplomatic relations, and resource sharing between communities
- Inter-settlement festivals, competitions, and collaborative projects
- Conflict resolution systems for territorial or resource disputes

**Kingdom Formation:**
- Advanced settlements can form alliances and kingdoms
- Kingdom-level projects require coordination between multiple communities
- New administrative roles: Regional Governor, Trade Commissioner, Military Commander
- Kingdom events create content for multiple settlements simultaneously

**Scaling Challenges:**
- Development resources must match community growth demands
- Server infrastructure needs to support multiple persistent settlements
- Content creation requirements increase exponentially with settlement diversity
- Community management tools become critical at larger scales

### Progression and Achievement Systems

**Settlement Milestones:**
- Community achievements unlock new buildings, roles, and systems
- Historical record-keeping preserves settlement legacies and notable events
