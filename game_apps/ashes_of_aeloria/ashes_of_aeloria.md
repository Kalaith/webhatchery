Here’s a **revised initial Game Design Document** for your war game, now fully centered on a **node-based tactical map** like *The Great Villainess: Strategy of Lily* while keeping the high-fantasy, commander-driven vision intact.

# **Game Design Document – Working Title: “Warborn Realms”**

## **Core Concept**

A **high-fantasy strategy game** where players control a roster of unique **commanders**—each with their own troop type, race, and special abilities—across a **node-based tactical map**.
The player must expand their faction by capturing **key nodes** (cities, resource points, magical landmarks), **managing supply lines**, and commanding armies in **large-scale auto-resolved or semi-interactive battles**.
The game blends **strategic map play**, **commander progression**, and **narrative-driven decision-making**.

## **1. Gameplay Overview**

### **Strategic Layer – Node-Based Map**

* **Nodes**: Represent strategic points such as cities, forts, mines, shrines, and magical landmarks.
* **Paths**: Connect nodes, forming a web of chokepoints and supply lines.
* **Fog of War**: Unexplored or enemy-held nodes are hidden unless scouted.
* **Control Zones**: Capturing nodes expands territory, increasing income and supply reach.
* **Events**: Nodes may trigger narrative or random events (rebellions, monster attacks, magical anomalies).

### **Turn Structure**

* **Phases per Turn**:

  1. **Player Phase** – Move commanders, capture nodes, initiate attacks, use map-wide abilities.
  2. **Enemy Phase** – AI executes counter-moves and attacks.
  3. **Upkeep Phase** – Resources collected, supply checked, events resolved.

## **2. Commanders & Armies**

### **Commanders**

* **Classes**: Knight (tank), Mage (AOE), Ranger (scout/skirmish), Warlord (leadership buff).
* **Race Variants**: Humans, Elves, Orcs, Undead, each with passive faction traits.
* **Progression**:

  * Leveling up improves stats and unlocks **skills**.
  * Equipment system for unique weapons/artifacts.
  * **Relationship System** – Keep commanders alive and invested in battles to build loyalty and unlock synergy bonuses.

### **Troop Types**

* **Core Types**: Soldiers (balanced), Archers (ranged), Cavalry (fast & flanking), Mages (support/AOE).
* **Rock-Paper-Scissors**:

  * Cavalry > Archers
  * Archers > Infantry
  * Infantry > Cavalry
  * Mages disrupt all but are fragile.

## **3. Node Types & Functions**

* **City/Town** – Generates gold, enables troop recruitment, restores commander stamina.
* **Resource Node** – Mines (gold), Farms (supplies), Mana Wells (mana for abilities).
* **Fortress** – Defensive stronghold with high garrison value; provides strategic defense bonuses.
* **Shrines/Ancient Sites** – Unlock global magical abilities or powerful one-time effects.
* **Special Nodes** – Unique map objectives (e.g., sealed ruins, enemy strongholds, boss lairs).

Each node can have a **Star Level (1–5)** representing fortification and difficulty to capture.

---

## **4. Battles**

* **Scale**: Large army-vs-army engagements (commander + 10–100 units).
* **Resolution**:

  * **Auto-resolved** by default based on army strength, commander abilities, morale, and terrain.
  * **Semi-Interactive Mode**: Players can adjust formations, trigger commander skills, or cast support spells.
* **Formations & Stances**: Aggressive (high damage, low defense), Defensive (hold ground), Skirmish (mobility).
* **Battlefield Terrain**: High ground, forests, choke points affect combat results.

---

## **5. Resources & Economy**

* **Gold** – Recruitment, upgrades, and fortification.
* **Supplies** – Needed to maintain armies; lack of supplies reduces troop morale and combat efficiency.
* **Mana** – Used for casting powerful battlefield or map-wide abilities (e.g., teleporting a commander, summoning reinforcements).

---

## **6. Narrative Integration**

* **Branching Storylines**: Player decisions (e.g., sparing or executing enemy commanders) influence endings.
* **Commander Bonds**: Unlock special episodes and synergy abilities by fostering relationships.
* **Moral Choices**: Decide between pragmatic or honorable actions with long-term consequences.

---

## **7. Victory Conditions**

* **Conquest Victory** – Capture a majority of strategic strongholds.
* **Artifact Victory** – Secure and protect all magical relic nodes.
* **Diplomatic Victory** – Forge alliances or vassalize rival factions.
* **Narrative Endings** – Achieve one of multiple story-based resolutions depending on choices made.

---

## **8. Key Features**

* **Node-Based Strategy**: Clear frontlines and chokepoints for tactical decision-making.
* **Commander-Centric Play**: Unique abilities and stories keep commanders central to gameplay.
* **Hybrid Battles**: Auto-resolution for speed, but optional semi-interactive control for key fights.
* **Dynamic Events**: Unpredictable map events (natural disasters, monster incursions, rebellion).
* **Multiple Races/Factions**: Each with unique playstyles and bonuses.
