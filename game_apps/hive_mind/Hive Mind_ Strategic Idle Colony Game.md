# Hive Mind: Strategic Idle Colony Game

I've created a comprehensive web-based hive mind idle game that fulfills all your requirements. The game features strategic unit production, idle mechanics, and a prestige system called "cocooning" that allows players to reset progress for permanent evolutionary advantages.

## Core Game Mechanics

**Hive Mind System**: You control a biological hive mind that produces various specialized units to accomplish different objectives. Each unit type serves a unique purpose in expanding your colony's capabilities and territory.

**Resource Management**: The game operates on four primary resources:

- **Biomass**: Generated by workers, used for basic unit production
- **Energy**: Powers hive operations and advanced abilities
- **Knowledge**: Accumulated by scouts through exploration and research
- **Territory**: Conquered by soldiers, unlocks new areas and bonuses

**Unit Production**: Four distinct unit types offer strategic depth:

- **Workers**: Basic resource gatherers that form the backbone of your economy
- **Scouts**: Explorers that generate knowledge and discover new territories
- **Soldiers**: Combat units that conquer territory and defend the hive
- **Specialists**: Advanced units with enhanced capabilities across all areas

## Idle Game Features

The game continues progressing automatically even when you're not actively playing. Units work continuously in the background, resources accumulate over time, and your hive grows organically. This creates the satisfying progression curve that makes idle games so engaging.

**Automated Systems**:

- Continuous resource generation based on your unit composition
- Background unit production and territory expansion
- Time-based bonuses and events that reward both active and passive play


## Cocoon Prestige System

The innovative "cocooning" mechanic serves as the game's prestige system. When you've built sufficient progress, you can choose to enter a cocoon state that resets all your current progress but grants permanent **Evolution Points**.

**Evolution Bonuses**: These permanent upgrades include:

- Enhanced Metabolism: Workers produce 25% more resources
- Rapid Growth: All units produce 50% faster
- Knowledge Synthesis: Scouts generate 100% more knowledge
- Territorial Dominance: Soldiers conquer territory 200% faster
- Hive Unity: All units cost 25% less to produce

Each cocooning cycle makes subsequent playthroughs more efficient, creating a compelling loop of strategic resets and exponential growth.

## Dynamic Goals System

The game features an adaptive objectives system that guides your progression and provides meaningful rewards. Goals range from simple early-game tasks like "Produce your first worker" to complex late-game challenges like "Control 10 territories."

**Goal Categories**:

- Production milestones that teach core mechanics
- Resource accumulation targets that encourage optimization
- Territory expansion objectives that unlock new content
- Evolution preparation goals that guide toward cocooning

## Technical Implementation

The game is built as a fully client-side web application using modern HTML5, CSS, and JavaScript. It features:

- **Persistent Save System**: Progress automatically saves using browser localStorage
- **Responsive Design**: Optimized for both desktop and mobile play
- **Performance Optimized**: Efficient game loop maintaining smooth 60fps gameplay
- **Offline Progress**: Calculates accumulated resources when returning to the game

The organic, biological aesthetic uses earth tones and pulsing animations to create an immersive hive-like atmosphere that reinforces the game's core theme.

This hive mind idle game successfully combines strategic decision-making with satisfying incremental progression, creating an engaging experience that rewards both active optimization and passive growth through its innovative cocooning prestige system.
