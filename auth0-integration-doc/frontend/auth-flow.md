# Authentication Flow for SES Frontend

This document outlines the authentication flow for the frontend application of the South Eastern Speedskaters (SES) platform, detailing how users will interact with the login system, including the steps for logging in, logging out, and handling authentication state.

## Overview

The SES frontend utilizes Auth0 for user authentication, allowing users to log in through multiple identity providers. The authentication flow is designed to be seamless and user-friendly, ensuring a secure experience for all users.

## Authentication Steps

### 1. User Login

- **Initiate Login**: 
  - Users click the "Login" button on the homepage or any protected route.
  - The application redirects users to the Auth0 login page.

- **Authentication Options**: 
  - Users can choose to log in using various methods, such as:
    - Email and Password
    - Social Logins (Google, Facebook, etc.)

- **Successful Login**: 
  - Upon successful authentication, Auth0 redirects users back to the application with a JWT token.
  - The application stores the token in local storage or a secure cookie.

### 2. Handling Authentication State

- **Token Verification**: 
  - The application verifies the JWT token to ensure it is valid and not expired.
  - If the token is valid, the user is granted access to protected routes.

- **User Profile Retrieval**: 
  - After login, the application fetches the user profile from the backend API using the stored token.
  - The userâ€™s information is displayed on the dashboard or profile page.

### 3. User Logout

- **Initiate Logout**: 
  - Users can log out by clicking the "Logout" button.
  - The application clears the stored JWT token from local storage or cookies.

- **Redirect to Auth0**: 
  - The application redirects users to the Auth0 logout endpoint to ensure the session is terminated on the Auth0 side.

- **Post-Logout Redirect**: 
  - After logging out, users are redirected back to the homepage or a designated landing page.

## Error Handling

- **Login Errors**: 
  - If login fails (e.g., incorrect credentials), the application displays an error message to the user.
  
- **Token Expiration**: 
  - If the token is expired, the application prompts the user to log in again.

## Conclusion

This authentication flow ensures that users have a secure and efficient experience when accessing the SES platform. By leveraging Auth0, the application can support multiple authentication methods while maintaining a high level of security.
