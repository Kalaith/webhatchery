# Auth0 Integration Documentation

## Overview

This project provides comprehensive documentation for integrating Auth0 into the South Eastern Speedskaters (SES) platform. The integration focuses on building a robust login system that supports multiple authentication portals, ensuring a seamless user experience across the frontend and backend applications.

## Project Structure

The documentation is organized into two main sections: **frontend** and **backend**. Each section contains specific documents that guide the implementation of Auth0 in their respective areas.

### Frontend

1. **auth-flow.md**: Outlines the authentication flow for the frontend application, detailing user interactions with the login system, including logging in, logging out, and managing authentication state.

2. **auth0-setup.md**: Provides instructions for setting up Auth0 in the frontend application, including creating an Auth0 application, configuring allowed callback URLs, and integrating the Auth0 React SDK.

3. **api-integration.md**: Describes how the frontend application communicates with the backend API for authentication purposes, covering API endpoints for login, logout, and user profile retrieval, along with example requests and responses.

### Backend

1. **auth-middleware.md**: Explains the middleware used in the backend to handle authentication, detailing how to verify JWT tokens, manage user sessions, and protect routes that require authentication.

2. **auth0-setup.md**: Outlines the steps for setting up Auth0 in the backend application, including instructions for configuring the Auth0 SDK, setting up environment variables, and integrating Auth0 with Express.js.

3. **api-endpoints.md**: Lists the API endpoints related to authentication in the backend, including details on user registration, login, logout, and profile management, along with required request formats and expected responses.

## Getting Started

To get started with the Auth0 integration, follow the instructions in the respective documents for the frontend and backend. Ensure that you have the necessary environment variables configured and that you understand the authentication flow to provide a smooth user experience.

## Conclusion

This documentation serves as a guide for developers to implement Auth0 in the SES platform effectively. By following the outlined steps and best practices, you can create a secure and user-friendly authentication system that meets the needs of the SES community.
