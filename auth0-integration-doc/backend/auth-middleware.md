# Auth0 Integration - Backend Authentication Middleware

## Overview

This document outlines the middleware used in the backend application to handle authentication with Auth0. It details the process of verifying JSON Web Tokens (JWT), managing user sessions, and protecting routes that require authentication.

## Middleware Implementation

### 1. JWT Verification

To ensure that incoming requests are authenticated, we will implement middleware that verifies the JWT provided by the client. This involves:

- Extracting the token from the `Authorization` header.
- Validating the token using the Auth0 public keys.
- Decoding the token to retrieve user information.

### 2. Middleware Code Example

Below is an example of how to implement the authentication middleware in Express.js:

```typescript
import { Request, Response, NextFunction } from 'express';
import jwt from 'express-jwt';
import jwksRsa from 'jwks-rsa';

// Configure JWT middleware
const jwtMiddleware = jwt({
  secret: jwksRsa.expressJwtSecret({
    cache: true,
    rateLimit: true,
    jwksRequestsPerMinute: 5,
    jwksUri: `https://YOUR_AUTH0_DOMAIN/.well-known/jwks.json`
  }),
  audience: 'YOUR_API_IDENTIFIER',
  issuer: `https://YOUR_AUTH0_DOMAIN/`,
  algorithms: ['RS256']
});

// Protect routes with the JWT middleware
const protectRoute = (req: Request, res: Response, next: NextFunction) => {
  jwtMiddleware(req, res, next);
};

// Export the middleware
export { protectRoute };
```

### 3. Managing User Sessions

Once the JWT is verified, you can manage user sessions by attaching user information to the request object. This allows subsequent middleware and route handlers to access user data.

### 4. Protecting Routes

To protect specific routes, simply apply the `protectRoute` middleware to any route that requires authentication:

```typescript
import express from 'express';
import { protectRoute } from './auth-middleware';

const router = express.Router();

router.get('/protected', protectRoute, (req, res) => {
  res.send(`Hello ${req.user.name}, you have access to this protected route.`);
});

export default router;
```

## Conclusion

This middleware setup ensures that all incoming requests are authenticated and that only authorized users can access protected routes. By verifying JWTs and managing user sessions, we can maintain a secure and robust authentication system in the backend application.
