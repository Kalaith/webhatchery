# Auth0 Integration Setup for Backend

This document outlines the steps required to integrate Auth0 into the backend of the SES application. It covers the configuration of the Auth0 SDK, setting up environment variables, and integrating Auth0 with Express.js to manage authentication.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js installed on your machine
- An Auth0 account
- Basic knowledge of Express.js and middleware

## Step 1: Create an Auth0 Application

1. Log in to your Auth0 dashboard.
2. Navigate to the "Applications" section.
3. Click on "Create Application."
4. Choose a name for your application and select "Regular Web Application."
5. Click "Create."

## Step 2: Configure Application Settings

1. In the application settings, note the following values:
   - **Domain**
   - **Client ID**
   - **Client Secret**

2. Set the following allowed callback URLs:
   - `http://localhost:3000/callback` (or your production URL)

3. Set the allowed logout URLs:
   - `http://localhost:3000` (or your production URL)

4. Save the changes.

## Step 3: Install Auth0 SDK

In your backend project directory, install the Auth0 SDK and required dependencies:

```bash
npm install express-jwt jwks-rsa dotenv
```

## Step 4: Set Up Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the root of your backend project and add the following variables:

```
AUTH0_DOMAIN=your-auth0-domain
AUTH0_CLIENT_ID=your-auth0-client-id
AUTH0_CLIENT_SECRET=your-auth0-client-secret
```

Replace the placeholders with the values obtained from your Auth0 application settings.

## Step 5: Configure Express.js Middleware

In your Express.js application, set up the middleware to handle JWT verification. Create a new file named `auth.js` in your backend directory and add the following code:

```javascript
const express = require('express');
const jwt = require('express-jwt');
const jwksRsa = require('jwks-rsa');
require('dotenv').config();

const auth = express.Router();

const jwtCheck = jwt({
  secret: jwksRsa.expressJwtSecret({
    cache: true,
    rateLimit: true,
    jwksRequestsPerMinute: 5,
    // Your Auth0 domain
    jwksUri: `https://${process.env.AUTH0_DOMAIN}/.well-known/jwks.json`
  }),
  audience: process.env.AUTH0_CLIENT_ID,
  issuer: `https://${process.env.AUTH0_DOMAIN}/`,
  algorithms: ['RS256']
});

// Protect routes with JWT verification
auth.use(jwtCheck);

module.exports = auth;
```

## Step 6: Integrate Middleware into Your Application

In your main server file (e.g., `server.js` or `app.js`), import and use the authentication middleware:

```javascript
const express = require('express');
const auth = require('./auth');

const app = express();

// Use the auth middleware
app.use(auth);

// Define your routes here

const PORT = process.env.PORT || 3000;
app.listen(PORT, () => {
  console.log(`Server is running on port ${PORT}`);
});
```

## Step 7: Test the Integration

1. Start your backend server.
2. Use a tool like Postman to test your API endpoints that require authentication.
3. Ensure that valid JWT tokens are accepted and invalid tokens are rejected.

## Conclusion

You have successfully integrated Auth0 into the backend of the SES application. This setup allows for secure authentication and authorization of users through JWT tokens. For further customization and advanced features, refer to the [Auth0 documentation](https://auth0.com/docs).
