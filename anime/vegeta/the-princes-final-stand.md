# The Prince's Final Stand
*A Dragon Ball Super Fanfiction*

---

## Chapter 1: Return to the Graveyard

The reconstructed Planet Vegeta hung in space like a monument to loss, its restored surface bearing the scars of its violent past. Super Dragon Balls had brought the world back from nothingness, but no wish could resurrect the billions of Saiyans who had perished in Frieza's attack decades ago. Vegeta stood on a rocky outcrop, his cape billowing in the alien wind as he surveyed the barren landscape that had once been his birthright.

"Still brooding over ancient history, monkey?"

The voice cut through the silence like a blade. Vegeta didn't turn around—he didn't need to. That cold, mocking tone had haunted his nightmares for over thirty years.

"Frieza." Vegeta's voice was steady, controlled. "Right on time."

Black Frieza materialized behind him, his obsidian form radiating power that made the very air crackle with energy. The tyrant's latest transformation had elevated him beyond anything the universe had seen—ten years of training in a Hyperbolic Time Chamber had created a monster that could defeat Ultra Instinct Goku and Ultra Ego Vegeta simultaneously.

"I must admit, I'm curious why you requested this little meeting," Frieza said, his tail swishing with amusement. "Surely you haven't forgotten our last encounter? You and that buffoon Kakarot barely lasted five minutes."

Vegeta finally turned, his dark eyes burning with decades of suppressed rage. "That was then. This is now."

"Oh?" Frieza's lips curved into that familiar, sadistic smile. "Have you discovered some new transformation in the weeks since our last meeting? Found some mystical power-up hidden in the ruins of your dead world?"

"Something like that." Vegeta's aura began to flicker, purple energy dancing around his form. "Tell me, Frieza—do you ever think about that day? The day you murdered my father and condemned my people to extinction?"

Frieza laughed, the sound echoing across the desolate landscape. "Think about it? My dear prince, it was Tuesday. Do you remember every ant you've stepped on?"

The casual dismissal hit Vegeta like a physical blow. His aura flared brighter, but he held his transformation in check. Not yet.

"That's the difference between us," Vegeta said. "You see genocide as a trivial Tuesday. I see it as the defining moment of my existence. Every day since then has been building toward this."

"How touching." Frieza's power began to rise, black energy radiating from his form. "Well then, shall we make this reunion memorable? I promise to make your death slightly less pathetic than your father's."

## Chapter 2: The Dance Begins

Vegeta exploded into Ultra Ego, his purple aura erupting skyward as his hair shifted to match. The transformation's destructive energy carved trenches in the ground beneath his feet, but Frieza remained unimpressed.

"Ultra Ego again? Really, Vegeta, I expected more creativity from the so-called Prince of all Saiyans."

Without warning, Frieza vanished. Vegeta barely had time to register the movement before a devastating punch sent him crashing through three mountain ranges. The impact created a crater the size of a city, dust and debris filling the air.

But Vegeta was already rising, and his aura was brighter than before.

"What's wrong, Frieza?" Vegeta wiped blood from his mouth, his smile cold and predatory. "That felt weaker than last time. Are you holding back on me?"

Frieza's expression flickered with confusion. "Impossible. That blow should have—"

Vegeta's counterattack came faster than Frieza expected. A vicious uppercut caught the tyrant in the solar plexus, launching him into the upper atmosphere. Vegeta followed instantly, purple energy trailing behind him like a comet.

"Let me explain something to you," Vegeta snarled as he caught up to Frieza in mid-air. "Ultra Ego doesn't just make me stronger. It makes me stronger every time you hurt me. Every blow you land feeds my power."

He delivered a series of punches that would have leveled continents, each one crackling with destruction energy. Frieza blocked most of them, but the sheer ferocity of the assault drove him back toward the planet's surface.

"You think I don't know how your little transformation works?" Frieza sneered, catching Vegeta's fist in his palm. "I've studied your techniques, Prince. The question is: can you grow stronger faster than I can kill you?"

Frieza's counterattack was brutal. A knee strike to Vegeta's ribs produced an audible crack, followed by an elbow that sent the Saiyan prince spinning through the air. But with each impact, Vegeta's aura grew more intense, more chaotic.

"That's the beauty of this transformation," Vegeta gasped, his breathing labored but his eyes blazing with determination. "Pain doesn't weaken me anymore. It empowers me. Every humiliation, every defeat, every moment of agony—they're all fuel for the fire."

## Chapter 3: The Tyrant's Doubt

The battle raged across Planet Vegeta's surface, two titans of power carving new geography with every exchange. Frieza's black form moved with liquid grace, his attacks precise and devastating. But Vegeta absorbed each blow like a sponge, his Ultra Ego form growing more unstable and more powerful with every passing moment.

"You're enjoying this," Frieza observed, his breathing slightly elevated for the first time in the fight. "The pain, the violence—you're actually enjoying it."

"Finally understanding, are we?" Vegeta's laugh was harsh, bitter. "This is what you made me, Frieza. A weapon designed for one purpose—your destruction."

Vegeta's next attack shattered the sound barrier. His fist, wreathed in purple destruction energy, caught Frieza across the jaw and sent the tyrant tumbling across the landscape. But Frieza recovered quickly, his black aura flaring as he prepared his most devastating technique.

"Enough games," Frieza hissed. "Let's see how your precious transformation handles this."

A massive Death Ball formed above Frieza's palm, black energy swirling with enough power to obliterate a solar system. The attack dwarfed anything he had used against Vegeta before—this was meant to end the fight in a single blow.

"You want to feel pain, Prince? Let me give you more than you can handle."

The Death Ball descended like a falling star, its gravitational pull warping space around it. Vegeta looked up at the approaching annihilation and did something that shocked Frieza to his core.

He opened his arms wide and smiled.

"Thank you, Frieza. This is exactly what I needed."

## Chapter 4: Embracing Destruction

The Death Ball struck Vegeta directly, its explosion visible from space. The blast carved away a quarter of Planet Vegeta's surface, leaving a glowing crater that pulsed with residual energy. Frieza floated above the devastation, breathing heavily from the exertion of creating such a massive attack.

"Finally," he muttered. "The monkey prince is—"

A pillar of purple light erupted from the crater's center. Vegeta rose from the destruction like a dark angel, his Ultra Ego form transformed beyond recognition. His aura had become a raging inferno of destruction energy, his muscles rippling with power that made the air itself scream in protest.

"Impossible," Frieza whispered. "That attack should have atomized you."

"It did," Vegeta replied, his voice echoing with otherworldly power. "But I've learned something about destruction, Frieza. It doesn't just end things—it creates opportunities for rebirth."

The Saiyan prince's power had transcended its previous limits. The massive damage from Frieza's ultimate attack had triggered something unprecedented in Ultra Ego's evolution—a temporary ascension that pushed Vegeta beyond even Black Frieza's level.

"Do you feel it?" Vegeta asked, purple energy crackling around his form. "That cold touch in your chest? That's fear, Frieza. You haven't felt it in so long, you'd forgotten what it was like."

For the first time in eons, Frieza took a step backward. His perfect ki control wavered as he stared at the transformed Saiyan before him. This wasn't possible. His Black form was absolute, the pinnacle of power in Universe 7. No one should be able to threaten him.

"This... this is just a temporary surge," Frieza stammered. "Once your adrenaline fades, you'll be the same pathetic monkey you've always been."

"Perhaps," Vegeta acknowledged. "But temporarily is all I need."

## Chapter 5: Royal Judgment

Vegeta's assault was relentless. Each strike carried the weight of decades of suppressed rage, the accumulated grief of an entire extinct race. His fists moved faster than light, each impact sending shockwaves across the planet's remaining surface.

Frieza tried to defend himself, but his movements seemed sluggish compared to Vegeta's enhanced speed. The black tyrant who had dominated the universe for so long found himself being systematically dismantled by the prince he had tormented since childhood.

"How does it feel, Frieza?" Vegeta's voice was ice-cold as he landed a devastating blow to the tyrant's midsection. "To be the one who's helpless? To be at the mercy of someone stronger?"

Frieza coughed up blood, his obsidian form crackling with unstable energy. "You... you can't... maintain this forever. When your power fades, I'll make you suffer for an eternity."

"You're right," Vegeta admitted, pausing his assault. "This form is burning through my life force. I probably have minutes before it consumes me entirely."

He grabbed Frieza by the throat, lifting the tyrant to eye level. "But minutes are all I need to end this. All the training in all the time chambers in existence won't save you from what comes next."

Vegeta's free hand began to glow with an energy unlike anything he had ever channeled before. It wasn't just destruction energy—it was the combined will of every Saiyan who had ever lived, their spirits flowing through their prince in his moment of ultimate need.

"This technique has no name," Vegeta said, his voice carrying the weight of royal authority. "But if I had to call it something... Royal Judgment sounds appropriate."

## Chapter 6: The End of an Era

The attack built slowly, purple and gold energy swirling around Vegeta's hand like a miniature galaxy. Frieza struggled against the prince's grip, his own power seeming insignificant compared to the cosmic forces gathering around them.

"Wait," Frieza gasped. "We... we can make a deal. I can bring back your people, your planet, everything I destroyed. The Dragon Balls—"

"The Dragon Balls can't bring back what you took from me," Vegeta interrupted. "My father's pride. My people's honor. My childhood. Some things, once destroyed, can never be restored."

The energy reached critical mass. Vegeta could feel his life force burning away, consumed by the tremendous power flowing through him. But it didn't matter. This moment, this single opportunity for justice, was worth any price.

"Tell me, Frieza," Vegeta said, his voice barely a whisper. "When you meet my father in the afterlife, will you still call him a monkey?"

"Vegeta, please—"

"This is for King Vegeta." The energy pulsed brighter. "For every Saiyan child who never got to grow up." Another pulse. "For every warrior who died serving you." The attack reached its peak. "And for the prince you tried to break but could never truly defeat."

The Royal Judgment erupted outward, a column of destructive energy that pierced the heavens themselves. Frieza's scream echoed across dimensions as the attack unmade him at a molecular level, his black form dissolving into nothingness.

When the light faded, Vegeta stood alone on the ruined surface of Planet Vegeta. His Ultra Ego form flickered and died, leaving him in his base state, blood streaming from countless wounds. But his eyes held a peace they hadn't known in over thirty years.

"It's done, Father," he whispered to the empty sky. "The tyrant is dead. Your son has finally come home."

## Epilogue: The Prince's Peace

Goku found Vegeta three hours later, unconscious but alive among the ruins of the ancient Saiyan capital. The battle's devastation was visible from orbit—entire continents had been reshaped, the planet's rotation slightly altered by the cosmic forces unleashed during the fight.

"Vegeta," Goku said softly, kneeling beside his rival. "What did you do?"

Vegeta's eyes opened slowly, focusing on Goku's concerned face. "What I should have done decades ago," he replied, his voice hoarse but satisfied. "I kept my promise."

"Promise?"

"To make Frieza pay for what he did to my people." Vegeta struggled to sit up, Goku supporting him. "It's over, Kakarot. Finally, truly over."

As the two Saiyans waited for rescue, Vegeta looked out over the transformed landscape of his homeworld. The scars of battle would heal, given time. Plants would grow again, life would return to this place of ancient death. But most importantly, the weight that had pressed down on his shoulders for so long was finally gone.

For the first time since childhood, Vegeta felt free.

Somewhere in the distance, the wind carried what might have been the whispered approval of long-dead kings, welcoming their prince home at last.
